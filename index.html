          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            It is a historical site.
            <strong>Navratna Fort of Raja Bhoj</strong> is located here due to
            which , the name of the village is called
            <strong><em>Naya Bhojpur</em></strong
            >.It is known from the pages of history that the fort was built in
            1633 by <strong><em>King Rudra Pratap Narayan Singh</em></strong
            >.It is famous for that there were
            <strong>52 streets and 56 markets</strong> inside the
            fort.Unfortunately,the Mughal ruler caught sight of it and within 3
            years , Mughal Subedar Abdullah Khan of Bihar demolished it.Later
            Baimat khan, son of Syed Khan of Mughal Rule, came to Bhojpur as
            Shahi Alamdar.He named Bhojpur as Shahabad.After 1764, when the
            British rule occupied this area, Shahabad district was formed on the
            basis of the same name.Today there are four parts Ara,Buxar,Sasaram
            and Bhabhua.Whem Shahabad was divided, Bhojpur and now Bhojpur
            district is known as Ara.This is the glorious history of Buxar
            district.
